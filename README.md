# Lending_Club_Loan_Default_Prediction_Model
Loan default prediction model using Logistics Regression.
# Introduction:
This project is based on famous Lending_Club case. 
Lending club is a U.S based peer-to-peer lending platform. 
It connects individual borrowers to individual investor-lenders through online platforms. 
Investors are able to search and browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they wante to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose, etc. 
Investors make money from the interest on these loans. LendingClub make money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
# Project Objective:
The aim of this project is to predict the chance that a loan will charge off, 
i.e., the customers who are not able to pay back the loan amount. 
Since customers who don't pay back their loan amount are a source of loss for the company, 
we want to build a machine learning model based on 12 years (2007-2019) of accepted loan applications data, 
which can predict if a particular applicant will or will not be able to payback the loan amount. 
The problem is treated as a binary classification problem i.e. default or not default and a suitable predictive model is built.
# Prediction Model:
There are 2 prediction models (Version1 and 2). Version 2 is the built-on on version 1, to improve the accuracy.
# Overview of steps involved in building the model:
1. Loading & Reading Data
2. Missing Value Analysis
3. Feature selection
4. Data slicing
5. EDA
6. Missing value treatment
7. Categorical variables Encoding
8. Preparing the model
9. Using Logistic Regression to predict
10. Evaluating the model
11. Improving the model
12. Conclusion
